# Containerized Instructions

This should be more reproducible. It worked in late June 2023.

1. Download the `dmpls.tar.xz` and `smplh.tar.xz` into the folder `body_model/`.
2. Have Docker installed.
3. Start the container (there is also a `.devcontainer` config for easy opeining in VSCode). It will take a while (possibly many minutes) to set up everying, but then all dependencies should be there.
4. Run the scripts as described in the main docs.
